OAuth2 (Open Authorization 2.0) is a protocol that lets users authorize apps to access their data—without giving away their password. It’s like giving someone a keycard that only opens specific doors, not your whole house.
In FastAPI, we often use a simplified version called the OAuth2 Password Flow, which is perfect for APIs where users log in with a username and password to get a token.



1. OAuth2PasswordBearer
- This is a dependency class that tells FastAPI:
- “Expect a token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.”

- You use it like this:
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")
- It doesn’t validate the token—it just extracts it from the request so you can validate it yourself.

2. OAuth2PasswordRequestForm- This is used in your /token endpoint to receive login credentials.
- It expects form data with:
- username
- password
- (optionally) scope
- Example:
@app.post("/token")
async def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    # form_data.username and form_data.password are now available
🧪 How It All Fits TogetherHere’s the typical flow:- User logs in → sends username & password to /token
- Server verifies credentials → returns a JWT token
- Client stores token → sends it in Authorization: Bearer <token> header
- Protected endpoints → use Depends(oauth2_scheme) to extract and validate token
🧠 Why Use OAuth2 in FastAPI?- ✅ Standardized and secure
- 🔄 Stateless (no server-side sessions)
- 🔍 Easy to integrate with JWT
- 📜 Automatically generates “Authorize” button in Swagger docs

🔐 Authentication vs Authorization

- Authentication → Verifying who the user is (login, tokens, API keys)
- Authorization → Checking what the user can access (roles, permissions).

FastAPI doesn’t come with a “full” authentication system built-in (like Django), but it provides tools and integrations.

1. Authentication Methods in FastAPI

a) OAuth2 with Password (and JWT Tokens)

""A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties—most commonly between a client (like a browser or mobile app) and a server. It's widely used in authentication and authorization workflows for APIs and web applications.

""""
    - Most common for APIs.
    - Use OAuth2PasswordBearer and JWT for stateless authentication.

    - Workflow:
        - User logs in with username + password.
        - App verifies credentials → returns JWT access token.
        - Client sends token in Authorization:
        Bearer <token>.
        - Backend validates token for each request.
