ðŸ”¹ FastAPI Depends

FastAPI provides dependency injection using Depends. It allows you to declare and reuse logic (like authentication, validation, DB connections, business rules) across multiple routes.

âœ… How it works
1. You define a function (dependency) that performs some task.
2. In your path operation function, you use Depends to call and inject that dependency.
3. FastAPI automatically resolves and provides the return value of the dependency.

âš¡ In short: Depends is FastAPIâ€™s way of doing dependency injection â€” making routes modular, reusable, and secure.


ðŸ”¹ What are Class-based Dependencies?

Instead of writing a function, you can define a class with an __init__ method that accepts parameters (from query, headers, etc.).
FastAPI will automatically create an object of that class and inject it into your route via Depends.

ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s just another way to organize dependencies, especially useful when you have multiple related parameters that belong together
